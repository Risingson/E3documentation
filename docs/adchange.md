# Mobile app monetarization addition
Dear Pilot,

in the last year i worked hard to implement the most asked for feature to share data amongst fellow pilots.

Up until now the mobile app was running fully clientside. This meant it stored all data on your phone/tablet and did not need a server backend at all. 

Along a load of new features and improvements in this new version the following features were introduced needing a server backend maintained by eveeye:

- Cloud storage to sync your data amongst your devices/browsers
- Share your location with a group of players
- Share wormhole connections and jump bridges
- Share signatures (parsing via browser version)
- Share system marks and their names
- Pulling 24h and 48h activity stats from eveeye server

New users still see a nag-banner while those of you having purchased to remove nag-banners don't.

I hope you understand this move to maintain a server backend system in the future.<br>
If you got questions don't hesitate to contact support@eveeye.com<br>

Best Regards<br>
Risingson
