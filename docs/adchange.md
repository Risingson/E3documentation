# Mobile app monetarization change

Dear Pilot,

in the last year i worked hard to implement the most sought for features to share data amnongst fellow pilots.

Up until now the app was running fully clien.side, meaning it stored all data on your phone/tablet and did not need a server backend at all.

In this new version the following features were introduced that need a server backend maintained by eveeye:

- Cloud storage to sync your data amongst your own devices
- Share your location with a group of players
- Share wormhole connections
- Share signatures (parsing via browser version)
- Pulling 24h and 48h activity stats from eveeye server

New users still see a nag-banner while those of you having purchased to remove nag-banners don't.

I am very sorry for the inconvienance.
If you got questions don't hesitate to contact support@eveeye.com
