This graph shows activity within the solarsystem of the recent 48 hours. Its layout will show same hours of the day in the same column to easily check what activity may be expected the upcoming hours.
The green NOW annotation shows the current hour of the day.
Therefore the box to the left of the text NOW shows the most recent activity.
In this example it is currently between 8 and 9 o´clock. The most recent jumps recorded in that solarsystem are 1.204 jumps which occurred between 7 and 8 o´clock:
