### Regional 
Map of a single region and adjacting systems of other regions.

### Chain 
Map of your wormhole chain.

### Radar 
This map-type displays all systems up to 5 jumps away from the system set as center of the map regardless of the region they belong to. It will also include systems connected via jumpbridges or wormholes. It suits especially fine when using [Intel Channels](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sharing/intel-channels/).
To set the system range displayed use the following icons in bottom left:<br>

Especially high-sec systems got too many connected systems to display 5 levels.
