# Chain Mapping

## Mechanics
#### Automatic connection creation
 - While syncing your ingame location jumps via wormholes or jump-bridges will get mapped automatically.

#### Automatic connection creation-
 - Wormhole connections get removed after 48h latest. You can always remove them manually by clicking the connection line and selecting `Remove Connection` from the solarsystem menu.
 - A connection will get created when jumping a cyno. Stop sync before jumping or remove the connection created manually.
 - When pasting wormhole signatures connections to "Unknown Systems" will get created
 - You can add connections manually via the menu entry `Add Connection`

<!--
#### Viewable Information 
 - For wormhole systems there is no api data available for recent jumps or NPC kills.
 - Phenomenons are stated as an extra sub-label. To view its effects click the wormhole and select `Show Info` from the menu and switch to the `WH` tab.

In solarsystem info pane's `SIG` tab you can merge "Unknown System" connections via dragging and dropping onto wormhole connections created by jumping them.

## Name wormholes
Clicking wormhole systems will show a `Set Wormhole Name` option in solarsystem menu.
