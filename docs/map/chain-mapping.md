# Chain Mapping

## Mechanics
While syncing your ingame location jumps via wormholes or jump bridges will get mapped automatically.

Wormhole connections get removed after 48h.

A connection will get created when jumnping a cyno. Stop sync before jumping or remove the connection created manually.

For wormhole systems there is no api data available for recent jumps or NPC kills.

## Connection Lines
Connection lines are colored, solid or dashed.

|type| meaning |
|--|--|
| blue lines | Not end of life |
| red lines | End of life |
| solid lines | Stability not reduced |
| dashed line | Stability reduced|
| wide dashed line| Stability critical |
| dotted line| Frigate sized |

## Add data to connections
To add data to connections you can click wormhole connection lines or click wormholes in the solarsystem info pane within the "SIG" tab.

In solarsystem info pane's "SIG" tab you can drag pasted wormhole signatures onto wormhole connections to merge the signature code. This will stop that sig from being displayed under signatures. This is a browser only feature.

## Name wormholes
Clicking wormhole systems will show a "Set Wormhole Name" option in solarsystem menu.
