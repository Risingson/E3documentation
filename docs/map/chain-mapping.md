# Chain Mapping

## Mechanics
While syncing your ingame location jumps via wormholes or jump bridges will get mapped automatically.

Wormhole connections get removed after 48h.

A connection will get created when jumnping a cyno. Stop sync before jumping or remove the connection created manually.

For wormhole systems there is no api data available for recent jumps or NPC kills.

## Connection Lines
|type| meaning |
|--|--|
| blue lines | Not end of life |
| red lines | End of life |
| continous lines | Stability not reduced |
| dashed line | Not end of life |
| wide dashed line| blue lines | Not end of life | | Not end of life |

## Add data to connections
To add data to connections you can click wormhole connection lines or click wormholes in the solarsystem info pane within the "SIG" tab.

In solarsystem info pane's "SIG" tab you can drag pasted wormhole signatures onto wormhole connections to merge the signature code. This will stop that sig from being displayed under signatures. This is a browser only feature.

## Name wormholes
Clicking wormhole systems will show a "Set Wormhole Name" option in solarsystem menu.
