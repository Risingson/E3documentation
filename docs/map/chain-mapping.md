# Chain Mapping

## Mechanics
While syncing your ingame location jumps via wormholes or jump bridges will get mapped automatically.

Wormhole connections get removed after 48h.

A connection will get created when jumnping a cyno. Stop sync before jumping or remove the connection created manually.

For wormhole systems there is no api data available for recent jumps or NPC kills.

## Add data to connections
To add data to connections you can click wormhole connection lines or click wormholes in the solarsystem info pane.
