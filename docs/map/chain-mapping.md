# Chain Mapping

## Mechanics

 - While syncing your ingame location jumps via wormholes or jump
   bridges will get mapped automatically.
 - Wormhole connections get removed after 48h.
 - A connection will get created when jumnping a cyno. Stop sync before
   jumping or remove the connection created manually.
 - For wormhole systems there is no api data available for recent jumps
   or NPC kills.
 - Phenomenons are stated as an extra sub-label. To view its effects
   click the wormhole and select "Show Info" from the menu.

## Styles
Solarsystem oultines are solid or dashed. 
Connection lines are colored and solid or dashed.

|Type| Meaning |
|--|--|
| Dashed system outline | Shattered wormhole |
| Blue lines | Not end of life |
| Red lines | End of life |
| Solid lines | Stability not reduced |
| Dashed line | Stability reduced|
| Wide dashed line| Stability critical |

## Add data to connections
To add data to connections you can click wormhole connection lines or click wormholes in the solarsystem info pane within the "SIG" tab.
You can edit:<br>
**Signature codes on both sides**<br>
**K162 side**<br>
**Wormhole code**<br>

In solarsystem info pane's "SIG" tab you can drag pasted wormhole signatures onto wormhole connections to merge the signature code. This will stop that sig from being displayed under signatures. This is a browser only feature.

## Name wormholes
Clicking wormhole systems will show a "Set Wormhole Name" option in solarsystem menu.
