# Chain Mapping (TBD)

While syncing your ingame location jumps via wormholes or jump bridges will get mapped automatically.

Wormhole connections get removed after 48h automatically.
A connection will get created when podded, clone jumping or cynoing. Remove the created connection manually.


For wormhole systems there is no api data available for Jumps or NPCs destroyed last hour.
