# Chain Mapping

## Mechanics
#### Automatic connection creation
 - While syncing your ingame location jumps via wormholes or jump-bridges will get mapped automatically.
 - A connection will get created when jumping a cyno. Stop sync before jumping or remove the connection created manually.
#### Manual connection creation
 - You can add connections manually via the menu entry `Add Connection`
#### Connection creation via Signature pasting
 - When pasting wormhole signatures connections to "Unknown Systems" will get created
 - Click the created connection to set its destination

 - Either enter the wormhole code or at unknown incomings the destination security or class. "T" stands for Thera and "P" for Pochven.
 
#### Wormhole removal
 - Wormhole connections get removed after 48h latest. You can always remove them manually by clicking the connection line and selecting `Remove Connection` from the solarsystem menu.

 - When pasting wormhole signatures connections to "Unknown Systems" will get created

## Add data to connections
To add data to connections you can right-click wormhole connection lines or click wormholes in the solarsystem info pane within the "SIG" tab.
You can edit:<br>

 - Signature codes on both sides<br>
 -  Wormhole code<br>
 - K162 side<br>
 - Label<br>

In solarsystem info pane's `SIG` tab you can merge "Unknown System" connections via dragging and dropping onto wormhole connections created by jumping them.

## Name wormholes
Clicking wormhole systems will show a `Set Wormhole Name` option in solarsystem menu.
