# Chain Mapping

## Mechanics
While syncing your ingame location jumps via wormholes or jump bridges will get mapped automatically.

Wormhole connections get removed after 48h.

A connection will get created when jumnping a cyno. Stop sync before jumping or remove the connection created manually.

For wormhole systems there is no api data available for recent jumps or NPC kills.

## Add data to connections
To add data to connections you can click wormhole connection lines or click wormholes in the solarsystem info pane within the "SIG" tab.

In solarsystem info pane's "SIG" tab you can drag pasted wormhole signatures onto wormhole connections (need to be scanned beyond 25%) to merge the signature code. This will stop that sig from being displayed under signatures. This is a browser only feature.
