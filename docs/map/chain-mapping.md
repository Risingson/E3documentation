# Chain Mapping

## Connection creation
### Automatic connection creation
 - While syncing your ingame location jumps via wormholes or jump-bridges will get mapped automatically.
 - A connection will get created when jumping a cyno. Stop sync before jumping or remove the connection created manually.
 
### Manual connection creation
 - You can add connections manually via the menu entry `Add Connection`
 
### Connection creation via Signature pasting
 - When pasting wormhole signatures connections to "Unknown Systems" will get created
 - Click the created connection to set its destination

 - Either enter the wormhole code or at unknown incomings the destination security or class. "T" stands for Thera and "P" for Pochven.

### Merging automatically created and pasted connections
 - In solarsystem info pane's `SIG` tab you can merge "Unknown System"
   connections via dragging and dropping onto wormhole connections
   created by jumping them.

## Connection editing

### Wormhole removal
 - Wormhole connections get removed after 48h latest. 
 - If you have set the wormhole code the removal will adopt that wormhole's expiration.
 - If you set a wormhole "End of Life" the timer will be set to 4 hours left.
 - You can always remove connections manually by clicking the connection line and selecting `Remove Connection` from the solarsystem menu.
 
### Add or edit connection data
To add data to connections you can right-click wormhole connection lines or click wormholes in the solarsystem info pane within the "SIG" tab.
You can edit:<br>

 - Signature codes on both sides<br>
 - Wormhole code<br>
 - K162 side<br>
 - Life state<br>
 - Mass state<br>
 - Label<br>
