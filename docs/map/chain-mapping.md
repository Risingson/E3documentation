# Chain Mapping

While syncing your ingame location jumps via wormholes or jump bridges will get mapped automatically.

Wormhole connections get removed after 48h.

A connection will get created when jumnping a cyno. Stop sync before jumping or remove the connection created manually.

For wormhole systems there is no api data available for recent jumps or NPC kills.
