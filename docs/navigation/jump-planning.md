# Jump Planning (work in progress)

### Enabling using a jump-drvie for route planning
Enable `Use Jumpdrive` in `ROUTE` settings.<br>
Set your jump-ship and skills in `JUMP` settings.<br>

#### Jump settings
|  |  |
|--|--|
| `Use Jumpdrive` | Toggles if the route-planner will plot a jump route. |
| `Prefer Less Midpoints/Isotopes` | Sometimes a route with more mids needs less fuel. |
| `Jump if more than X Gates` | This sets the planner to always use its jumpdrive or only plot a jump if the gate distance to the next mid is more than X gates. |
| `Leaving Highsec` | Sets if you want to travel highsec as far as possible and jump from there (`Gate afar`) or if you want to jump as soon as possible (`Jump asap`). |
| `Prefer Station Systems` | The planner will try to jump via systems that got an NPC-station. |
| `Include dockable structures` | This option appears if you chose to prefer station systems. The planner would try to plot jumps via systems that got an NPC-Station or an [added structure](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sharing/structures/) set to `DOCK` or `BLUE`. |

### How to plot a route
#### Choosing the system to start the route from
Choose a System to start from. When tracking location that would be your current location system. If not tracking location you can set a system your current location by doubleclicking it or right-clicking it and choosing `Set Current System` from the menu.

#### Menu options
After right-clicking or doubletapping a system on mobile in addition to general and gate route options you will get presented with the following navigation options as applicable:
|  |  |
|--|--|
| Set Jump Destination | Will plot a jump-route to the system according to your settings. |
| Append Jump Destination | Will add a jumproute to an existing route. |
