# Jump Planning (work in progress)

### Enabling using a jump-drvie for route planning
Enable `Use Jumpdrive` in `ROUTE` settings.<br>
Set your jump-ship and skills in `JUMP` settings.<br>

#### Jump settings
|  |  |
|--|--|
| Use Jumpdrive | Toggles if the route-planner will plot a jump route. |
| Prefer Less Midpoints/Isotopes | Sometimes a route with more mids needs less fuel. |
| Jump if more than X Gates | This sets the planner to always use its jumpdrive or only plot a jump if the gate distance to the next mid is more than X gates. |
| Leaving Highsec | Sets if you want to travel highsec as far as possible and jump from there (`Gate afar`) or if you want to jump as soon as possible (`Jump asap`). |
| Prefer Station Systems | The planner will try to jump via systems that got an NPC-station. |
| Include dockable structures | This option appears if you chose to prefer station systems. The planer would try to plot jumps via systems that got an NPC-Station or an [added structure](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sharing/structures/) set to `DOCK` or `BLUE`. |

### How to plot a route
#### Choosing the system to start the route from
Choose a System to start from. When tracking location that would be your current location system. If not tracking location you can set a system your current location by doubleclicking it (browser) or doubletapping it and choosing "Set Current System" from menu.
