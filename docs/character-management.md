<h1 id="character-management">Character Management</h1>
<p>Logging in characters is not necessary to use this app but unlocks the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Track your ingame location</li>
<li>Interact with the EVE client like setting waypoints etc.</li>
<li>Sync your data across devices</li>
<li>Share your data with other pilots</li>
<li>Display relayed ingame intel channel data</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="eve-online-single-sign-on-sso">EVE Online Single-Sign-On (SSO)</h2>
<p>This app uses the <a href="https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/205381192-Single-Sign-On-SSO-">EVE Online Single Sign On (SSO)</a> to authenticate characters. Since the ingame browser has been removed it is not possible to track your ingame location without a SSO login hence using an API KEY is not an option anymore.</p>
<p>If you got security concerns regarding your login credentials consider using two factor authentication. It can be enabled in EVE account management: <a href="https://secure.eveonline.com/authenticator/" target="_blank">https://secure.eveonline.com/authenticator/</a></p>
<h2 id="login-process">Login process</h2>
