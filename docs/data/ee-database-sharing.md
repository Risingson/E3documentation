# Custom data sharing (Echoes)
When logged in database sets will get stored remotely and would synchronize to any device you use eveeye from.

## Share a dataset on discord
#### Add a map
To share a map on discord you need to fill the `Sharing` info. Enter a discord server name there and hit enter. If you are a part of that server it will get linked to it.
Anyone else that is authenticated on Eveeye with a user on that same discord server will now be able to see that map within his set list and may add that map to display.
#### Remove a map from sharing
To not share a map anymore hit `UNLINK` within the `Sharing` info line of a set's details. This will not remove the latest version from anyone who added that map but it would not get updated for them anymore. If removed by the ones using that legacy map it cannot be added back.
#### Map ownership
Currently a map is owned by the user that created it originally. Also only that user can edit the map.
