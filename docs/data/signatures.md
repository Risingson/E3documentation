<h1 id="signatures">Signatures</h1>
<p>Since there is no eve-api for signatures they can only be pasted to browser versions of eveeye.<br>
On mobile apps however you can see signatures shared by pilots within your group.</p>
<p>You can copy and paste signatures from the EVE client using Ctrl+C an paste them on the active browser window of Eveeye.<br><br><br>
Signatures get added to your current ingame location.<br>If you are not syncing your location sigs get added to the system you are showing info on.<br><br>
<br>Pasting will open the SIG info tab.<br>In this tab signatures and wormhole connections are shown.<br>You can drag wormhole signatures onto wormhole connections to merge the signature ID.<br><br></p>
<p>You can delete a signature by clicking the X top right of it and confirm.<br><br>
Deleted sigs can be undeleted for up to 3 hours.<br><br><br>
You can show and hide anomalies, cosmics and deleted sigs by clicking the corresponding tab above the signatures displayed.</p>
