# Character Management
Logging in characters is not necessary to use this app but unlocks the following features:

 - Track your ingame location
 - Interact with the EVE client like setting waypoints etc.
 - Sync your data across devices
 - Share your data with other pilots
 - Display relayed ingame intel channel data

## EVE Online Single-Sign-On (SSO) 
This app uses the [EVE Online Single Sign On (SSO)](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/205381192-Single-Sign-On-SSO-) to authenticate characters. Since the ingame browser has been removed it is not possible to track your ingame location without a SSO login hence using an API KEY is not an option anymore.

## Your data
Unless you enable the Cloud services no data gets stored on Eveeye server.

If you got security concerns regarding your login credentials consider using two factor authentication. It can be enabled in EVE account management: <a href="https://secure.eveonline.com/authenticator/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">https://secure.eveonline.com/authenticator/</a>
