# Location Tracking
Enabling synchronization with the EVE Online Client will trigger the following:

 - Start fetching your ingame location to follow your ship on the map
 - [Waypoint](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sync/waypoints/) setting to Eve client
 - Using your current ship for jumprange calculations
 - Start [sharing](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sharing/cloud/) your data if you chose to do so

## Tracking multiple characters at once
This can be achieved by running multiple browser instances. 

### Chrome
[Create a chrome user](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9310144?hl=en#2.2) per character and track each character with its own instance.

### Firefox
There is an extension for [multi-account containers](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers) available by firefox.

### Edge
Microsoft Edge browser opens a new instance when starting the browser. Track one character per instance.<br>

### Other browsers
Just search the web on how to open separate instances of that browser and track one character per instance.<br>

!!! warning "Live kill-stream may fail"
    When running multiple instances with zKill livestream enabled the service may stop working for you would send too many requests from the same IP-address. It is recommended using it only on one instance.
