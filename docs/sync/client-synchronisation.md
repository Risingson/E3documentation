## Setting Waypoints
With sync active you got the possibility to set destinations/waypoints from Eveeye to the EVE client. To do this tap/click a solarsystem. I the appearing menu hit *Set Waypoint* or *Set Destination*.
### Option Use Wormholes/Jumpbridges
When you got one or both of the options *Use Wormholes* or *Use Jumpbridges* enabled in [Routing Settings](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ui/settings/#Route) calculating the route will consider those connections. If a route is found that includes wormholes or jumpbridges waypoints will be set accordingly.
An example: We like to go from PR-8CA to Nasreri.
 A route including a detour via Thera was found.![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Risingson/eedocs/master/docs/images/route/route_wh_ee.png)
 If you Set Destination to Nasreri via Eveeye the app will set a waypoint at PUIG-F. There you would have to find the entrance to Thera. From there find the exit to Vecamia.
 In the client your route would look like this since it does not know about Thera:

There you go taking the risk to halve the jumps on your journey.
