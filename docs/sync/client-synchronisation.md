# Client Sync
Enabling Client sync will trigger the following:

 - Start fetching your ingame location to follow your ship on the map
 - [Waypoint](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sync/waypoints/) setting to Eve client
 - Using your current ship for jumprange calculations
 - Start [sharing](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sharing/cloud/) your data if you chose to do so

### Edge
You can just open multiple instances of Microsoft Edge browser.<br><br>

!!! warning "Live zKill stream"
    When running multiple instances with zKill livestream enabled the service may stop working since you would send too many requests from the same IP-address. I recommend using it only on one instance.
