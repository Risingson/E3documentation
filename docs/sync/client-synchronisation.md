# Client Sync
Enabling Client sync will trigger the following:

 - Start fetching your ingame location to follow your ship on the map
 - [Waypoint](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sync/waypoints/) setting to Eve client
 - Using your current ship for jumprange calculations
 - Start [sharing](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sharing/cloud/) your data if you chose to do so

## Tracking multiple characters at once
This can be achieved by running multiple browser instances. 

### Chrome
Create a chrome user per character and track each character with its own instance:<br>

### Firefox
There is an extension for multi-account containers available by firefox:<br>
[https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers)

### Edge
Microsoft Edge browser opens a new instance when starting the browser. Track one character per instance.<br>

### Other browsers
Just search the web how to open a new instance of that browser and track on character per instance.<br>

!!! warning "Live kill-stream"
    When running multiple instances with zKill livestream enabled the service may stop working for you would send too many requests from the same IP-address. I recommend using it only on one instance.
