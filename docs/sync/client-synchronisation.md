## Setting Waypoints
With sync active you got the possibility to set destinations/waypoints from Eveeye to the EVE client. To do this tap/click a solarsystem. I the appearing menu hit *Set Waypoint* or *Set Destination*.
### Option Use Wormholes/Jumpbridges
When you got one or both of the options *Use Wormholes* or *Use Jumpbridges* enabled in [Routing Settings](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ui/settings/#Route) calculating the route will consider those connections. If a route is found that includes wormholes or jumpbridges waypoints will be set accordingly.
An example: We like to go from PR-8CA to Nasreri.
 A route including a detour via Thera was found.![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Risingson/eedocs/master/docs/images/route/route_wh_ee.png)
 If you Set Destination to Nasreri via Eveeye
