# Client Sync
Enabling Client sync will trigger the following:

 - Start fetching your ingame location to follow your ship on the map
 - [Waypoint](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sync/waypoints/) setting to Eve client
 - Using your current ship for jumprange calculations
 - Start [sharing](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sharing/cloud/) your data if you chose to do so

## Tracking multiple characters at once
This can be achieved by running multiple browser instances. 

### Chrome
Create a chrome user per character and track each character with its own instance:<br>

### Firefox
There is an extension for multi-account containers available by firefox:<br>
[https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers)

### Edge
Microsoft Edge browser opens a new instance when starting the browser. Track one character per instance.<br><br>

### Other browser
Just search the web how to open a new instance of that browser and track on character per instance.

!!! warning "Live zKill stream"
    When running multiple instances with zKill livestream enabled the service may stop working since you would send too many requests from the same IP-address. I recommend using it only on one instance.
