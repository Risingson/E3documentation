# Waypoints
With sync active you got the possibility to set destinations/waypoints from Eveeye to the EVE client. 

## Interaction
To do this tap/click a solarsystem. I the appearing menu hit `Set Waypoint` or `Set Destination`.
When a route was plotted via Eveeye you can interact with it via the legend on the right.
***This feature is in development***


## Wormholes/Jumpbridges
When you got one or both of the options `Use Wormholes` or `Use Jumpbridges` enabled in [Routing Settings](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ui/settings/#Route) calculating the route will consider those connections. If a route is found that includes wormholes or jumpbridges waypoints will be set accordingly.

#### Example
We like to go from `PR-8CA` to `Nasreri`.<br>
The shortest route from `PR-8CA` to `Nasreri` via k-space is 32 jumps.<br> ![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Risingson/eedocs/master/docs/images/route/Wormhole_routing_00.png)

A 12-jump route using a detour via Thera was found:<br>![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Risingson/eedocs/master/docs/images/route/Wormhole_routing_0.png)

If you `Set Destination` to `Nasreri` via Eveeye the app will set a waypoint at `PUIG-F`. There you would have to find the entrance to Thera. The corresponding Signature Code is found in the solarsystem-tab SIG or on the line on the map. From Thera do the same for the exit -in this case- to `Vecamia`. After jumping back to k-space the client will show the last 4 jumps.<br>

Within the EVE Client your route would look like this though since the client does not plot routes via wormholes:<br>![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Risingson/eedocs/master/docs/images/route/Wormhole_routing_03.png)
