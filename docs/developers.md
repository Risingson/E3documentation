### Mac and Linux Desktop App
I got no installer available for those platforms. You can download the program at [https://nwjs.io/downloads/](https://nwjs.io/downloads/).
A reference on how to package for that platforms can be found [here](http://docs.nwjs.io/en/latest/For%20Users/Package%20and%20Distribute/#platform-specific-steps).

Extra files: [package.json](https://www.dropbox.com/s/83yjmh3ktzatuny/package.json?dl=0), [logo.png](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b9adylfp2x1fmw6/logo.png?dl=0), [nw.icns](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0u6pfn6qkm33u5t/nw.icns?dl=0)

!!! help "Help needed"
    If you can do a working package for one of those platforms i would be happy if you could provide it via github and let me know.
