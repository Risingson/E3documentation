# Discord Login

In Eveeye Echoes you can authenticate a character via Discord. At the moment this enables the following.

 - Synchronize your Database Sets across devices
 - Share Database sets with people on a Discord Server


## Share a map on discord
To share a map on discord you need to fill the Sharing info. Enter a discord server name there and hit enter. If you are a part of that server it will get linked to it.
Anyone else that is authenticated on Eveeye with a user on that same discord server will be able to add the map
