## Share a map on discord
#### Add a map
To share a map on discord you need to fill the Sharing info. Enter a discord server name there and hit enter. If you are a part of that server it will get linked to it.
Anyone else that is authenticated on Eveeye with a user on that same discord server will be able to add the map to his sets.
