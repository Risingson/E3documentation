# Echoes authenticated character features

In Eveeye Echoes you can authenticate a character via Discord. At the moment this enables the following.

 - Synchronize your Database Sets across devices
 - Share Database sets with people on a Discord Server


## Custom Maps (database sets)
When logged in database sets will get stored remotely and would synchronize to any device you use eveeye from.

## Share a map on discord
#### Add a map
To share a map on discord you need to fill the `Sharing` info. Enter a discord server name there and hit enter. If you are a part of that server it will get linked to it.
Anyone else that is authenticated on Eveeye with a user on that same discord server will be able to add the map to his sets.
#### Remove a map from sharing
To not share a map anymore hit `UNLINK` within the `Sharing` info line of a set's details.
#### Map ownership
Currently a map is owned by the user that created it originally. Also only that user can edit the map.
