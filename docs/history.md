### Moondoggie tools
After i started playing Eve and was trying to gather information and looking for tools i started to tailer tools for my self soon. The first one i made public was an invention calculator in [YEAR?].

When starting to get around new eden i wanted to know where i am and started what was the very first attempt of what eveeye became later. It was called HHGTTG and i wanted it to become nothing less than a "Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy".

Which became IPS "Interplanetary Positioning System" later.
