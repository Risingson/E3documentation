## Moondoggie tools
After i started playing Eve in 2006 and was looking for tools i started to tailor tools for myself soon. The first one i made public was an invention calculator in 200?

When starting to get around new eden i wanted to know where i am and started what was the very first attempt of what eveeye became later. It was called **HHGTTG** and i wanted it to become nothing less than a "Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy".

Which became **IPS** "Interplanetary Positioning System" later. `Add eve release info at that time`
I at that time traveled each and every special site of New Eden and did screenshots to see within IPS and later Eveeye.
