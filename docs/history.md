## Moondoggie tools
After i started playing Eve in early 2006 and was looking for tools i started to tailor some for myself soon. The first one i made public was an invention calculator.

When starting to get around new eden i wanted to know where i am and started what was the very first attempt of what eveeye became later. It was called **HHGTTG** and i wanted it to become nothing less than a "Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy".

Which became **IPS** "Interplanetary Positioning System" later. `Add eve release info at that time`
I at that time traveled each and every special site of New Eden and did screenshots to see within IPS and later Eveeye.

By the time my own server was slowly dying on the Windows Server 2003 end of life. The only option -apart from discontinuing- was to shut down the active server pages and do a complete re-write.

## Eveeye Explorer (2016)
Still sad that i had to offline Eveeye due to the technology i used was deprecated i started to code a fully client-side mobile app to not be dependant on maintaining a server backend. This reduced the costs a lot and i wanted to try that for years anyway.  

    add a bit of EEE dev steps
