# Jump bridges

## Adding a jump bridge
While there is no api available to add jump bridges to the maps  (see e.g. [https://github.com/esi/esi-issues/issues/1084](https://github.com/esi/esi-issues/issues/1084)) you can add them by 

 - Jumping the bridge and set it to jump bridge afterwards
 - Paste it to eveeye window from directional or overview. If you got a list of copied JBs line by line you can paste them all at once.

## Routing
When clicking a jumpbridge connection you got three options to choose from
|  |  |
|--|--|
| Red JB | Will show red on the map. Not used for routing. |
| Use for Routing | Will show green on the map. Used for routing. |
| Red JB | Will show blue on the map. Not used for routing. |
When adding new jumpbridges they get added green by default.
For further explanations on routing please refer to [Waypoints](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sync/waypoints)
