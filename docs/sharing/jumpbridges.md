# Jump bridges

## Adding a jump bridge
While there is no api available to add jump bridges to the maps  (see e.g. [https://github.com/esi/esi-issues/issues/1084](https://github.com/esi/esi-issues/issues/1084)) you can add them by 

 - Jumping the bridge and set it to jump bridge afterwards
 - Paste it to eveeye window from directional or overview. If you maintain a list of copied JBs line by line you can paste them all at once.

## Routing
please refer to [Waypoints](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sync/waypoints)
