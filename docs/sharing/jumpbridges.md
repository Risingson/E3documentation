# Jump bridges

## Adding a jump bridge
While there is no api available to add jump bridges to the maps  (see e.g. [https://github.com/esi/esi-issues/issues/1084](https://github.com/esi/esi-issues/issues/1084)) you can add them by 

 - Jumping the bridge and set it to jump bridge afterwards
 - Paste it to eveeye window from directional or overview. If you got a list of copied JBs line by line you can paste them all at once.

## Routing
When clicking a jumpbridge connection you got three options to set
|  |  |

| Red JB | Will show red on the map |
