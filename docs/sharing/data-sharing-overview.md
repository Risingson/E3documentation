# Data Sharing

Basically Eveeye Explorer apps do store all data locally (client-side). If you do not enable the cloud service no data will ever get sent anywhere.

## Cloud Storage
Turning on Cloud Storage enables you to backup and sync data amongst your own devices and would enable options to share data with other pilots.

### Shared data
 - Wormhole Connections
 - Signatures
 - Shared Custom Marks
 - Your pilot's location and ship

### Additionally backuped data
 - Map Presets
 - Own Custom Marks

## Share groups
Enabling Cloud will not share data with anyone unless you choose to do so

| Type | Description |
|--|--|
| Corporation | Only pilots within your alliance can see your data   |
| Alliance | Only pilots within your alliance can see your data |
| Group | Only pilots using the same group code share data |


## Remove character and data from cloud
Disabling cloud will delete all data related to that character from cloud.
Removing a character via Character Management will not delete its data from cloud.

Synced amongst your devices would be map presets, signatures, connections, marks and names.

Shared with other pilots would be your location and ship, signatures, connections and shared marks and their names.
