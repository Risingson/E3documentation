<h1 id="data-sharing">Data Sharing

</h1>
<p>Basically E3 does store all data locally. If you do not enable the cloud service no data will ever get sent anywhere.

</p>
<p>Turning on Cloud Storage enables you to backup and sync data amongst your own devices and would enable options to share data with other pilots.

</p>
<p>Enabling Cloud will not share data with anyone unless you choose to do so

</p>
<p>Disabling cloud will delete all data related to that character from cloud.<br>
Removing a character via Character Management will not delete its data from cloud.

</p>
<p>Synced amongst your devices would be map presets, signatures, connections, marks and names.

</p>
<p>Shared with other pilots would be your location and ship, signatures, connections and shared marks and their names.</p>
