# Data Sharing

Basically Eveeye Explorer apps do store all data locally (client-side). If you do not enable the cloud service no data will ever get sent anywhere.

## Cloud Storage
Turning on Cloud Storage enables you to backup and sync data amongst your own devices and would enable options to share data with other pilots.

Enabling Cloud will not share data with anyone unless you choose to do so

Disabling cloud will delete all data related to that character from cloud.
Removing a character via Character Management will not delete its data from cloud.

Synced amongst your devices would be map presets, signatures, connections, marks and names.

Shared with other pilots would be your location and ship, signatures, connections and shared marks and their names.
