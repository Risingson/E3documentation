# Cloud

Basically Eveeye Explorer apps do store all data locally (client-side). If you do not enable the cloud service no data will ever get sent anywhere.

## Cloud Storage
Turning on Cloud Storage enables you to backup and sync data amongst your own devices and would enable options to share data with other pilots.

!!! info
    The Cloud storage is hosted on eveeye's webhost [easyname](https://www.easyname.com/en).

### Personal data synced but not shared
 - Map Presets
 - Bookmarks
 - Saved Routes
 - Personal Custom Marks
 - Personal Solarsystem Names

### Shared with pilots in your sharing group
- Your pilot's location and ship
- Wormhole Connections and Jump-bridges
- Signatures
- Structures 
- Shared Custom Marks
- Shared Custom Marks Names
- Shared Solarsystem Names
- Shared Solarsystem Notes
<!-- - Intel data via [Desktop App](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/desktop-app/) -->

## Sharing groups
Enabling Cloud will not share data with anyone unless you choose to do so

| Type | Description |
|--|--|
| Do not share data | Nobody can see your data (default)   |
| Corporation | Only pilots within your corporation can see your data   |
| Alliance | Only pilots within your alliance can see your data |
| Group | Only pilots using the same group code can see your data |

## Other options
### Switch custom marks
These are the toggles to use your own not shared custom marks or the ones shared with your sharing group.

### Manage Intel channels
Add and remove ingame [intel channels](/app#id=MdHMEpdOs5PbRjBr)
!!! warning "Feature in development"
    This feature is only available using the Windows [desktop app](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/desktop-app/). 
    
### Share and Show K-K Connections
If enabled the connections you jump via K-K wormholes would get shared publically and you can see the wormholes other people using this option are sharing. 

!!! warning "Limitation"
    Only connections that got edited with a signature-code or wormhole-code will get shown. This is to avoid showing connections that get created by cyno-jumping or using jump-bridges. 

## Remove character and data from cloud
Disabling cloud will delete all data related to that character from cloud.
Removing a character via Character Management will not delete its data from cloud.
