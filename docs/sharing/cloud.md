# Cloud

Basically Eveeye Explorer apps do store all data locally (client-side). If you do not enable the cloud service no data will ever get sent anywhere.

!!! warning
    Syncing data to and from mobile apps is not working yet. I am working on a new release for mobile to include syncing.

## Cloud Storage
Turning on Cloud Storage enables you to backup and sync data amongst your own devices and would enable options to share data with other pilots.

!!! info
    The Cloud storage is hosted on eveeye's webhost [easyname](https://www.easyname.com/en).

### Shared data
- Your pilot's location and ship
- Wormhole Connections
- Signatures
- Shared Custom Marks
- Intel data via [Desktop App](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/desktop-app/)


### Additionally backed up data
 - Map Presets
 - Own Custom Marks

## Share groups
Enabling Cloud will not share data with anyone unless you choose to do so

| Type | Description |
|--|--|
| Do not share data | Nobody can see your data (default)   |
| Corporation | Only pilots within your corporation can see your data   |
| Alliance | Only pilots within your alliance can see your data |
| Group | Only pilots using the same group code can see your data |

## Other options
### Switch custom marks
### Manage Intel channels
### Share and Show K-K Connections
If enabled the connections you jump via K-K wormholes would get shared publically and you can see the wormholes other people using this option are sharing. 
!!! warning "Limitation"
    Only connections that got edited with a signature-code or wormhole-code will get shown. This is to avoid false connections that get created by cyno-jumping or using jump-bridges.

## Remove character and data from cloud
Disabling cloud will delete all data related to that character from cloud.
Removing a character via Character Management will not delete its data from cloud.

Synced amongst your devices would be map presets, signatures, connections, marks and names.

Shared with other pilots would be your location and ship, signatures, connections and shared marks and their names.
