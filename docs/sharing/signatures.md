<h1 id="signatures">Signatures
</h1>
<p>Since there is no eve-api for signatures they can only be pasted to browser versions of eveeye. On mobile apps however you can see signatures shared by pilots within your group.

## Pasting
</p>
<h2 id="pasting">Pasting</h2>
<p>You can copy and paste signatures from the EVE client using Ctrl+C an paste them on the active browser window of Eveeye using Ctrl+V.

</p>
<p>Always paste all sigs from ingame since sigs in eveeye that are not in the pasted data will get deleted.

</p>
<p>Signatures get added to your current ingame location.<br>
If you are not syncing your location sigs get added to the system you are showing info on. 

## SIG tab
</p>
<h2 id="sig-tab">SIG tab</h2>
<p>Pasting sigs will open the SIG info tab. In that tab signatures and wormhole connection data get shown. In browser version you can drag wormhole signatures onto wormhole connections to merge the signature ID.
               
</p>
<p>You can delete a signature by clicking the X top right of it and confirm.

</p>
<p>Deleted sigs can be undeleted for up to 3 hours.<br>
You can show and hide anomalies, cosmics and deleted sigs by clicking the corresponding tab above the signatures displayed.

<p>The length of the bars to the left and right of the system node reflect the sig count of the corresponding type.

## Sharing
</p>
<h2 id="sharing">Sharing</h2>
<p>If you turned on [Data Sharing](<a href="https://eedocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sharing/data-sharing/)">Data Sharing</a> your signatures will get displayed to all other pilots in your sharing group.</p>
