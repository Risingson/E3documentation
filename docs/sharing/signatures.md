# Signatures
Since there is no eve-api for signatures they can only be pasted to browser versions of eveeye. On mobile apps however you can see signatures shared by pilots within your group.

## Pasting
You can copy and paste signatures from the EVE client using `Ctrl+C` an paste them on the active browser window of Eveeye.
Using `Ctrl+V` will `ADD` signatures to the system.
Using `Shift+Ctrl+V` will `OVERWRITE` all sigs within that system with the pasted ones.

Signatures get pasted to your current ingame location.
If you are not syncing your location sigs get added to the system you are showing info on. 

## SIG tab
Pasting sigs will open the SIG info tab of solarsystem info pane. In that tab signatures and wormhole connection data get shown. In browser version you can drag wormhole signatures onto wormhole connections to merge the signature ID.

Using the filter buttons you can toggle the display of those signatures or connections.
               
A signature can be deleted by clicking the `X` top right of it and confirm.

Deleted sigs can be undeleted for up to 3 hours.
You can show and hide anomalies, cosmics and deleted sigs by clicking the corresponding tab above the signatures displayed.                

## Map display

The length of the bars to the left and right of the system node reflect the sig count of the corresponding type.

## Sharing
If you turned on [Data Sharing](https://eedocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sharing/cloud/) your signatures will get displayed to all other pilots in your sharing group.
