### Own and Shared Marks
Only shared marks would be shared amongst your sharing group. Own marks never get shared. You got 2 possibilities to switch which marks you set and are displayed on maps: 
- Toggle them within the [sharing settings](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sharing/cloud/#Other-Options).
- Click the sharing icon to the left of the color dots in the solarsystem menu to switch 

### Name Marks
You can name marks within [Settings](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ui/settings/).  Click the little <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Risingson/eedocs/master/docs/images/Settings-100_off.png" width="24" height="24" > on the left within the menu to get there. 
If a named mark appears on a map it will show up in the legend.
