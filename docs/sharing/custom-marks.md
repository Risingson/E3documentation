### Own and Shared Marks
Only shared marks would be shared amongst your sharing group. Own marks never get shared. You got 2 possibilities to switch which marks you set and at the same time which ones get displayed on maps. Click "Personal" or "Shared" in the solarsystem menu to switch or Toggle them within the [sharing settings](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sharing/cloud/#Other-Options).

### Name 
You can name tags within [Settings](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ui/settings/).  Click the little <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Risingson/eedocs/master/docs/images/Settings-100_off.png" width="24" height="24" > on the left within the menu to get there. 

If a named tag appears on a map it will show up in the legend.
