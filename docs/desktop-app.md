# Desktop app
The desktop app uses [nw.js](https://nwjs.io/) and points that installable browser to eveeye.com.

## Installation
### Windows

The installation software used is [Inno Setup](https://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
[Windows installer download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/feo1z1055a7jmpd/Eveeye_v001.exe?dl=0)

If you do not trust the installer you can do the same as described for Mac and Linux below.

### Mac and Linux
I am sorry but i got no installer available for those platforms. 
If you are capable of stuff like this you can download the program at [https://nwjs.io/downloads/](https://nwjs.io/downloads/).
A reference on how to package for that platforms can be found [here](http://docs.nwjs.io/en/latest/For%20Users/Package%20and%20Distribute/#platform-specific-steps).

Extra files: [package.json](https://www.dropbox.com/s/83yjmh3ktzatuny/package.json?dl=0), [logo.png](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b9adylfp2x1fmw6/logo.png?dl=0), [nw.icns](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0u6pfn6qkm33u5t/nw.icns?dl=0)

#####  :milky_way: *If you can do a working package for one of those platforms i would be happy if you could provide it via github and let me know.*
